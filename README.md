1. Borrowing/Returning Books: Users can borrow or return books by entering their ID, name, reference, title, and date.
2. Book Management: Librarians can add, delete, and update books with all relevant information.
3. Librarian Management: Admins can add, delete, and update librarians and view all users in the database.
4. History: A record of all transactions of borrowing and returning books with the name of the librarian who performed the action.
5. Client Management: Admins can add, delete, and update clients and view all their information, including the name of the books they took.
